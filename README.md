Project Background
WasteWise addresses the pressing issue of electronic waste (e-waste) management. The project aims to enhance emissions tracking for companies adopting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies, leveraging the integration of 5G, IoT, and AI to provide a smart e-waste recycling solution. The focus is to create a sustainable e-waste management system that reduces carbon emissions and enhances public awareness, aligning with global efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of rapidly growing e-waste.
Purpose
WasteWise was conceived to solve the critical issue of e-waste management. The project's primary goal is to help tech companies and other organizations track, manage, and reduce their e-waste, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. By providing accurate data and insights, WasteWise aims to improve e-waste disposal practices, prolong the lifespan of electronic devices, and enhance companies' environmental profiles.
Functionality
1.	Smart E-Waste Bins: WasteWise introduces IoT-equipped bins to track e-waste disposal in real-time. These bins monitor the lifecycle and usage of discarded electronic products, providing data on e-waste generation.
2.	Centralized Dashboard: The collected data is updated in real-time to a centralized dashboard, allowing companies to monitor their e-waste metrics. This dashboard offers insights into purchasing habits, technology reuse, and inefficiencies in tech usage.
3.	AI Insights: WasteWise uses AI to analyze the data and highlight unused or inefficiently used technology. This allows companies to reallocate resources and optimize their tech usage.
4.	Public Web App: A public-facing web application rates local companies based on their e-waste management practices, rewarding those with efficient disposal methods. This promotes transparency and encourages eco-friendly corporate behavior.
Impact
WasteWise aims to:
•	Reduce Carbon Emissions: By improving e-waste management and prolonging the lifespan of electronic devices, WasteWise helps reduce the carbon footprint of tech companies.
•	Enhance Public Awareness: The public web app increases awareness of e-waste issues and promotes responsible disposal practices among consumers and businesses.
•	Promote Sustainable Practices: By providing data-driven insights and recommendations, WasteWise encourages companies to adopt more sustainable purchasing and disposal practices, ultimately benefiting the environment.
Learning Experience
Throughout the development of WasteWise, the team encountered several challenges and learning opportunities:
1.	Technical Challenges: Integrating IoT devices with a centralized dashboard and ensuring real-time data updates required significant technical expertise. Overcoming these challenges improved our understanding of IoT and data analytics.
2.	AI Implementation: Developing AI algorithms to analyze e-waste data and provide actionable insights was a complex task. This process deepened our knowledge of AI and machine learning applications in environmental solutions.
3.	Collaboration and Teamwork: Coordinating with team members across different locations and ensuring effective communication was crucial. This experience highlighted the importance of teamwork and efficient project management.
4.	User Experience Design: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the public web app required attention to detail and user feedback. This taught us the value of user-centered design in developing impactful solutions.
Reflections and Improvements
Reflecting on our journey, we recognize areas where we could have done better:
•	Early Prototyping: Starting with early prototypes and iterating based on user feedback could have streamlined the development process and improved the final product.
•	Resource Allocation: Better resource planning and allocation would have helped manage the project timeline more effectively, especially during peak development phases.
•	Enhanced Testing: Implementing more rigorous testing procedures earlier in the development cycle could have identified and resolved issues sooner, leading to a more polished final product.
Overall, WasteWise has been a rewarding project, combining technical innovation with environmental impact. The lessons learned and challenges faced have not only enhanced our technical skills but also our commitment to creating sustainable solutions for the future.
